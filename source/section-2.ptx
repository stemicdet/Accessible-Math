  <title>The Derivative</title>
  
  <p>
    The modern definition of the derivative is defined as follows.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>g:A \to \mathbf{R}</m> be a function defined on an interval <m>A</m>. Given <m>c\in A</m> the derivative of <m>g</m> at <m>c</m> is given by
    </p>
 

  <md>
    g'(c) = \lim_{x\to c} \frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}
  </md>

  <p>
    provided this limit exists. In this case we say <m>g</m> is differentiable at <m>c</m>. If <m>g'</m> exists for all points <m>c \in A</m> we say that <m>g</m> is differentiable on <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  </statement>
   </definition>
  
<p>
  Hidden in this definition is the <m>\epsilon</m>-<m>\delta</m> relationship that comes from the way that the limit is defined. The <m>\epsilon</m>-<m>\delta</m> definition of the derivative looks like this.
</p>
<definition>
<statement>
  <p>
  Let <m>g:A \to \mathbf{R}</m> be a function defined on an interval <m>A</m>. Then the derivative of <m>g</m> at <m>c \in A</m> is <m>L</m> if for every <m>\epsilon>0</m>, there exists <m>\delta>0</m> such that 
</p>

<md>
 \left| \frac{g(x)-g(c)}{x-c}-L \right| \le \epsilon
</md>

<p>
  whenever <m>|x-c| \le \delta</m>
</p>

<p>
  Note that by letting <m>x = c+h</m> the derivative can be rewritten as 
</p>

<md>
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{g(c+h)-g(c)}{h}
</md>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
  In geometry a tangent line to a curve is a line that touches the curve and follows the same direction as the curve at the point of contact.
